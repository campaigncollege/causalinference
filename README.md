This is (or will hopefully be) a community-edited syllabus for causal inference in political science (though it could be applied to most any social science). Thus far we have stolen from [Kosuke Imai](http://imai.princeton.edu), [Matt Blackwell](http://www.mattblackwell.org/), [Luke Keele](http://www.personal.psu.edu/ljk20/), Holger Kern, and Jennifer Hill.

The material is organized into books and articles, with articles grouped by subject. Feel free to fork, edit and issue a pull request for modifications of these documents, additions to them, or reorganizations. Please try to maintain a consistent citation style. Due to the fact that for-profit journals are leeches, we shouldn't actualy upload the articles themselves (please look at the existing links), but please provide a link to the paper on the journal's website (or a pre-print if you can find one).
